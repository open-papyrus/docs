# Optimizations

## The importance of optimizations

Optimizations are often the reason why compiled code runs so fast. Modern compilers have a wide range of optimizations available, some have significant performance impacts, reduce code size and make things easier for the CPU. Here is a C++ example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/ssP6PbEWj)):

```c++
int mulByConstant(int x) {
    return x * 65599;
}
```

The instructions generated are exactly what we imagine it to be, an `imul` (integer multiplication) of our input with `65599`:

```x86asm
mulByConstant(int):
    imul    eax, edi, 65599
    ret
```

Now what will happen if we wrote some very bad code that does the same thing ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/c6Kcr78Ex)):

```c++
int mulByConstant(int x) {
    return (x << 16) + (x << 6) - x;
    //         ^           ^
    //     x * 65536       |
    //                  x * 64
    // 65536x + 64x - 1x = 65599x
}
```

In this rather intimidating function we are doing the same thing (multiplying `x` with `65599`) however instead of using a multiplication we are using bit-shifts and additions.

```x86asm
mulByConstant(int):
    imul    eax, edi, 65599
    ret
```

The result that the compiler generated is the same as before, it looked at our arithmetic operations and understood we want to multiply by `65599`. It also knows that a single `imul` instruction is cheaper than whatever we wanted to do:

```x86asm
mulByConstant(int): # using bit-shifts with no optimizations
    push    rbp
    mov     rbp, rsp
    mov     dword ptr [rbp - 4], edi
    mov     eax, dword ptr [rbp - 4]
    shl     eax, 16
    mov     ecx, dword ptr [rbp - 4]
    shl     ecx, 6
    add     eax, ecx
    sub     eax, dword ptr [rbp - 4]
    pop     rbp
    ret
```

## Optimizing Papyrus

The CK compiler does not optimizations. It only tries to convert the raw code into a `.pex` file, doing only the bare minimum of work required to validate the code and produce an output. This is the reason why the code produces by a decompiler like [Champollion](https://github.com/Orvid/Champollion) is almost identical to the original code.

The next following pages contain information on every optimization done by the Open Papyrus Compiler.
