# Language Reference

This section focuses exclusively on the syntax and language constructs of Papyrus. **This is not an introduction to the language**.

Papyrus doesn't have a formal description like [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/), [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language) or [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html). Information is scattered throughout various sites, as seen in [Additional Resources](../Additional_Resources.md), and the main goal of this section is to unify all of it and provide a clean definition of the language.
