# Introduction

This website contains all information about the [Open Papyrus](https://github.com/open-papyrus) project. The project is centered around creating open-source tools and libraries for working with the Papyrus scripting language used in Skyrim and Fallout 4. We are also gathering and validating information around the language in order to guarantee the correctness of the tools and libraries we create.

You can find the source code for everything on [GitHub](https://github.com/open-papyrus). Here is a short list of things we are working on:

- [papyrus-compiler](./papyrus-compiler/Introduction.md): Open-source Papyrus compiler with a focus on optimizations

- [tree-sitter-papyrus](./tree-sitter-papyrus/Introduction.md): [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) plugin for Papyrus

- [Research and Validation](https://github.com/open-papyrus/research): Utility for research and validating assumptions based on previously made available information surrounding Papyrus as well as validating other theories on the inner workings of the Creation Kit compilers.

- [Papyrus Language Reference](./Papyrus_Language_Reference/index.md): A consistent and validated reference for the Papyrus language.
