The Open Papyrus Compiler is an open-source compiler for the Papyrus scripting language used in Skyrim and Fallout 4.

The compiler provided by Bethesda with the Creation Kit does the minimum amount of work required to produce an output. The CK compiler allows code with bugs to compile and does not optimize the code for better performance.

This project aims to create a modern Papyrus compiler for a better development experience and better runtime performance by creating meaningful diagnostics and applying optimizations.
